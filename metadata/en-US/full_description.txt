Get the password manager created by the scientists who met at CERN behind Proton Mail, the world’s largest encrypted email provider. Proton Pass is open source, end-to-end encrypted, and protected by Swiss privacy laws.

Pass offers more than other free password managers and has no ads or data collection. You can use it for free forever on all your devices to create and store unlimited passwords, autofill logins, generate 2FA codes, create email aliases, secure your notes, and more.

* How can Proton Pass be free forever?
We offer Pass for free because everyone deserves online privacy and security. This is possible thanks to our supportive community on paid plans. If you would like to support our work and get access to premium features, consider upgrading your plan.

* Protect more than just your passwords.
Join over 100 million people who have signed up for Proton’s privacy ecosystem, which includes Proton Mail, Proton Drive, Proton Calendar, Proton VPN, and more. Take back control of your privacy online with our encrypted email, calendar, file storage, and VPN.

* Protect your logins and their metadata with battle-tested end-to-end encryption
While many other password managers only encrypt your password, Proton Pass uses end-to-end encryption on all your stored login details (including your username, the website address, and more). Pass protects your information with the same battle-tested encryption libraries all Proton services use.

* Audit Pass’s open-source code
Like all other Proton services, Pass is open source and built on the principle of trust through transparency. As scientists, we know that transparency and peer review lead to better security. All Proton Pass apps are open source, meaning anyone can verify our security claims for themselves.
