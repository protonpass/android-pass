Before working on a new feature, please fill in [the ProtonMail support form](https://proton.me/support/contact) and select Proton Pass in the topic.

If you have a sensitive inquiry that requires absolute secrecy and which cannot go through our regular support system, you can email us directly and securely at contact@proton.me.

However, the response time for this will be longer than if using our support form.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure only essential dependencies are added to the project.
2. Ensure the description of the Pull Request contains an explanation of the changes made. If UI changes are performed, please include screenshots.
